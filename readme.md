# Imperator

A modular toolbox that wraps OpenCV functions to simplify image matching and
classification.

## information

I no longer develop or maintain this code. The initial idea was to create
simple wrappers for complex, but commonly used Computer Vision (and hence
OpenCV) algorithms. The focus was on any easy way to obtain similarity
information between two images.

The long-term idea grew to wrapping OpenCV to be used on the Linux command
line. Obviously, I have never gotten around to achieving that goal.

I hope parts of this code are still useful as a guide to using OpenCV.
